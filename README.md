# PropensityScoreCausalInference

A tutorial on the use of  potential outcomes as a meaans of identifying causal effects, including the use of propensity score-based methods for evaluating causal relationships. 

Materials are presented as a series of hyper-linked Google Documents, suitable for copying and adapting as desired.

# Description

## 1. Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this module, students will be able to:

1. Describe the concept of potential outcomes

2. Define an observational study and associated research question as a hypothetical randomized trial

3. Identify the key design issues for making causal inferences about an exposure or intervention of interest

4. Identify the key assumptions for making causal inferences with propensity score-based methods

5. Use causal graphs to specify appropriate models for identifying a causal relationship

6. Write an analysis plan to do each of the following steps:

    a. Model the assignment mechanism to predict subjectsâ€™ propensity for being treated or exposed
  
    b. Use the the propensity scores to create a pseudo population that aims to emulate a randomized trial
  
    c. Apply the appropriate outcomes model to estimate treatment/exposure effects 
  
    d. Conduct a sensitivity analysis to assess the degree of unmeasured confounding that could change results from a significant to non-significant result
